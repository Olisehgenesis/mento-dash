# Mento Reserve Dashboard - Assignment Summary

## üìã Assignment Overview

**Role**: Data & Ecosystem Insights Intern at Celo Foundation  
**Deadline**: 21:00 PM CEST on Friday, 18th July, 2025  
**Submit to**: internship@celo.org  

## üéØ Approach & Methodology

### Technology Choice: Dune Analytics

I chose to implement this dashboard using **Dune Analytics** for several strategic reasons:

1. **Real Blockchain Data**: Dune provides direct access to indexed blockchain data from both Celo and Ethereum
2. **Real-time Updates**: Live data feeds ensure the dashboard reflects current reserve states
3. **Professional Standard**: Dune is the industry standard for blockchain analytics and visualization
4. **Cost-effective**: No infrastructure costs or maintenance overhead
5. **Community Access**: Public dashboards can be easily shared and accessed by the Celo community

### Data Sources & Accuracy

- **On-chain Balances**: Direct queries to `celo.balances` and `ethereum.balances` tables
- **Real-time Pricing**: Live price feeds from `prices.usd` table
- **Verified Addresses**: All reserve addresses sourced from Mento's official analytics API
- **Cross-chain Coverage**: Comprehensive tracking across both Celo and Ethereum networks

## üìä Dashboard Implementation

## üîç Key Insights Discovered

### Reserve Composition Analysis

1. **Cross-Chain Strategy**: Mento maintains significant reserves on both Celo and Ethereum, demonstrating a sophisticated cross-chain approach to risk management.

2. **Asset Diversification**: The reserve shows a balanced mix of:
   - **Stablecoins** (USDC, USDT, EURC) for stability
   - **Cryptocurrencies** (CELO, ETH, WBTC) for growth potential
   - **Yield Assets** (stETH, sDAI) for passive income generation

3. **Protocol Integration**: Active use of DeFi protocols:
   - **Aave V3**: Lending positions for yield generation
   - **Uniswap V3**: Liquidity provision for trading fees

### Risk Management Observations

1. **Geographic Distribution**: Assets spread across multiple blockchain networks reduces single-chain risk
2. **Asset Type Balance**: Combination of volatile and stable assets provides both growth potential and stability
3. **Protocol Exposure**: Limited exposure to individual DeFi protocols mitigates smart contract risk

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Cross-Chain Data Integration
**Problem**: Combining data from Celo and Ethereum chains with different token standards
**Solution**: Created unified queries that handle different decimal places and token contracts appropriately

### Challenge 2: Real-time Price Integration
**Problem**: Ensuring accurate USD valuations across all assets
**Solution**: Leveraged Dune's `prices.usd` table with proper time synchronization

### Challenge 3: Protocol Position Tracking
**Problem**: Identifying assets held in DeFi protocols vs direct holdings
**Solution**: Created specific queries for protocol addresses and categorized holdings accordingly

### Challenge 4: Historical Data Performance
**Problem**: Balancing historical depth with query performance
**Solution**: Limited historical analysis to 30 days and used efficient aggregation techniques
